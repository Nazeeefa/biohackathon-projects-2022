    abstract = { Abstract This article summarizes the motivation for, and the proceedings of, the first ISA-TAB workshop held December 6–8, 2007, at the EBI, Cambridge, UK. This exploratory workshop, organized by members of the Microarray Gene Expression Data (MGED) Society's Reporting Structure for Biological Investigations (RSBI) working group, brought together a group of developers of a range of collaborative systems to discuss the use of a common format to address the pressing need of reporting and communicating data and metadata from biological, biomedical, and environmental studies employing combinations of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics technologies along with more conventional methodologies. The expertise of the participants comprised database development, data management, and hands-on experience in the development of data communication standards. The workshop's outcomes are set to help formalize the proposed Investigation, Study, Assay (ISA)-TAB tab-delimited format for representing and communicating experimental metadata. This article is part of the special issue of OMICS on the activities of the Genomics Standards Consortium (GSC). }

    abstract = "{The Investigation/Study/Assay (ISA) Metadata Framework is an established and widely used set of open source community specifications and software tools for enabling discovery, exchange, and publication of metadata from experiments in the life sciences. The original ISA software suite provided a set of user-facing Java tools for creating and manipulating the information structured in ISA-Tab—a now widely used tabular format. To make the ISA framework more accessible to machines and enable programmatic manipulation of experiment metadata, the JSON serialization ISA-JSON was developed.In this work, we present the ISA API, a Python library for the creation, editing, parsing, and validating of ISA-Tab and ISA-JSON formats by using a common data model engineered as Python object classes. We describe the ISA API feature set, early adopters, and its growing user community.The ISA API provides users with rich programmatic metadata-handling functionality to support automation, a common interface, and an interoperable medium between the 2 ISA formats, as well as with other life science data formats required for depositing data in public databases.}",
