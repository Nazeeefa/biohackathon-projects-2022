# Introduction

Biohackathon project 31 "The What & How in data management: Improving connectivity between RDMkit and FAIR Cookbook" was proposed by the joint editorial board of the RDMkit [@elixir_research_2021] and FAIR Cookbook [@philippe_rocca_serra_2022_7156792]. The aims of the project were 3-fold:

- Improve the technical interoperability between RDMkit & FAIR Cookbook
- Clarify and illustrate the ELIXIR research data management ecosystem for users
- Perform a gap analysis of the ecosystem for targeted content improvements.


# Technical integration

- YAML file
- potential PIDs for RDMK
- automatic metadata extraction


# Elixir Research Data Management Ecosystem

we worked on an intro page for the ecosystem because...

## User journeys

we created 6 user journeys for the Ecosystem pages and they are...


# Gap analysis

we actively looked for gaps in alignment/content and found some. They are....
  
  
# Discussion

We did what we did and it's good/bad because...


# Future work

Once we've recovered, we're going to do x, y and z.
